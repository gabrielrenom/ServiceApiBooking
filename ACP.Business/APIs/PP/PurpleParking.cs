You'll need to show your ticket to the driver.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt; If you have sports equipment or lots of luggage, you may need to wait for a bus with more space during busy times, so make sure you leave yourself plenty of time to get to the airport.&lt;/p&gt;</arrivalProcedure><departureProcedure>&lt;p&gt; The shuttle bus back to the car park leaves from bus stop 12 outside the terminal.

The machine will give you your car key back and show you on the screen where your car is.
